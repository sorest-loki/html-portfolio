<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>
I go by Sorest-loki (He/Him). I am a new software developer who is keen on learning necessary skills to work in Web Development.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp where I will be studying development using Javascript. Before this bootcamp, I attended university to study Computer Science. I learned a great deal in terms of programming fundamentals, and had the opportunity to work on projects using Java and C++ language.
</p>
<p>
While my focus is on learning about Web Development, I am always looking to work on projects. Once I feel inspired about a project, I can sink hours into planning, coding, and testing to get the project to work.
</p>
  
<h3>What I Currently Do Full-Time:</h3>
  
<p>
  I bring internet, phone, and television services to residential and business 
  settings within the Alamo city and surrounding areas. I aim to provide 
  reliable network access in a world where high-speed Internet is increasingly 
  becoming a necessity. I am adaptable to various forms of managerial guidance, 
  but I exceed in my career through my effective self-managed attitude.
